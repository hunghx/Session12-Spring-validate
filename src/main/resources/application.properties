app.body.content = The Russian military continues to use RBK-500 cluster bombs to neutralize fortified military bases of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Avdeevka area and surrounding areas. The use of these bombs equipped with thousands of fragmentation elements has a huge impact on enemy infantry, damaging air defense systems in the area as well as light armored vehicles. This step by Russia is a strong response to the Ukrainian army's shelling action targeting Russian-controlled areas.
